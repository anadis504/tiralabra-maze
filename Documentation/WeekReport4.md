# Weekly progress 4

This week I have been focusing on the testing of the program. Spent most time researching about testings and configuration in java and Netbeans. Luckily I got help with the pom and checkstyle configuration from Saska, which otherwise would have gotten me stuck for days. The project is now refactored into better suited packages and not default packages. The same with the testing classes and packages. Some test are written for the maze class and a little for Eller'salgo class. Have also updated the specification document a bit. But have to come back to it tomorrow, it is only just begun on. Next week I really hope to have gotten down the solving algorithms. Also the performance testing should be started on by next week I hope.
