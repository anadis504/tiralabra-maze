H1 Project Specification
Aim of this project is to create a labyrinth generator implementing Wilson’s and Eller’s Algorithms. The program will be based in a command line interface where the user can generate a maze of wanted size by any of the two methods. There will be a maze solver algorithm implemented as well. I was thinking of Trémaux's algorithm and maybe one more. Both algorithms create perfect mazes so I was thinking that the user could also decide where the entrance and exit of the labyrinth should be.

Algorithms and data structures
A char-table filled with walls works as a maze template for both generation algorithms. Both algorithms generate mazes by carving passages through the walls
