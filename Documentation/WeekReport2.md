#Weekly report 2

This week I have been looking at and reading about different maze generating algorithms. I will pick two of them to implement and compare. The chosen algorithms are:
Eller's algorithm 
Wilson's algorithm

Both algorithms create a perfect maze, having no loops or isolated areas and only one path from any point to another in the maze. In other words creating a spannig tree.
