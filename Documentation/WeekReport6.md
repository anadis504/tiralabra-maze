# Weekly progress 5

This week I have barely had the time to work on this project. The time spent mostly went to research (Javadocs, documentation, testing, the implementation document). 

The segment tree (index tree) for Wilsons Algo to use has been implemented and works, making Wilsons perform in "no time" compared to before. The largest size of maze I have managed to generate with Wilson is 120x120 before it throws StackOverFlow exceptions, so the slownes is not the issue. The Ellers Algo performs well and as expected is far more efficient concerning memory. I have successfully generated 10 000 x 10 000 size maze, although it could not be printed properly in netbeans - so all in all useless. The implementation document and the testing documents arecreated. The Javadocs are made for the two maze generating algo classes. For the other classes - coming.

I am totally stuck with the performance testing and would really appreciate some guidance in this matter. Also I have not heard anything about the demo presentation, I really hope it hasn't passed me by somehow! Honestly I am a bit exhausted and seriuosly considering maybe doing this course in the 3rd period. The biggest problem now is the timetable, only one week left and there is so much left to do in the documentation.
