# Weekly progress 5

This week I have barely had the time to work on this project.
I have tried to implement the Index tree for the Wilson's algo to use when fetching a unvisited cell, but I got totally stuck. The main problem seems to be when converting to dimentional array to segment tree and vice versa. I hope to get something done tomorrow as well, to get some feedback on it. Or then just be without it.
Have started on adding Javadocs to the code, and will continue with it tomorrow.
Have started working on implementation domcument. Will continue that tomorrow as well. Because I really need feedback on those documents as I just don't know whether they are going in the right direction at all.
The performance testing will also be for tomorrow. I have been waiting for the index tree, since the wilsons algo is very slow at the moment, but I guess I'll just have to go through with it now to get some feedback.
The biggest problem now is the timetable. Also the peer review will be undone this time because the project I got to review was too complicated for me.
