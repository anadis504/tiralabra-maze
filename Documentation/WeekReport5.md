# Weekly progress 5

This week I have made the solving algorithm (Tremaux method) and implemented a command-line user interface. That's about all I had energy and time to do this week unfortunately. By next week I definitely hope to get the project specification documents properly done. Also figure out how to run the program from the command line, since I at this moment only know how to deal with it through netbeans. There are two more data structures I would like to implement still, an index tree for the Wilson's algo to use when searching for un-visited cells for starting its random walk. That I think will increase the algorithm's efficiency quite a bit. And I am also excited myself to get to implement the tree (have to study it first only), it should work in O(logn)-time. The second would be to implement random number generating class, which is used by both my generation methods. I have added some tests - I have to say that that was the biggest practice-changer for me. My code usually behaves unexpectedly and I tend to put in a lot of "logging" to figure out where it goes wrong. But now I just write a test for it. That was a fun realization, and made test writing really interesting as part of coding and not this evil I-don't-know-how-to-thing to do after the class works somehow. 

Sorry for this messy text! Hope for more time next week.

Unfortunately the code review will not get done this time, hopefully next time!

Time spent 15h
