## Performance testing
The performance tests can be run from the user interface. The tests are run for maze size up to 1000x1000 (n = 1000 000). Wilson's algorithm's maximum capacity is 180X180 before the stack runs out of memory and throws StackOverFlow exception.

#### The results illustrated for mazes up to size 180x180 (maximum size of Wilson's generation algorithm)
