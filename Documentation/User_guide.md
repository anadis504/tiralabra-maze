# User Guide

The program is run in netbeans. By running the program user interface will provide the user with needed instructions.
User can decide which algorithm to use for maze generating. The interface will ask for the size (amount of rows, amount of columns).
After generating the maze user may ask the program to show the solution. Since the program generates perfect mazes with no loops and no isolated areas the user will be ask to provide the entrance and exit coordinates.
