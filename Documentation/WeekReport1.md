It has taken some time to get an overview over this course. Not only getting through the course materials, but getting some sort of a picture of what is expected of me. I had a very vague and complicated idea of what a program is. After helpful guidance from Saska and following his advice and suggestions I have decided to base my project on labyrinths. It is a topic that I find very motivating and it is something that according to Saska also could be scaled up easily. Which suites me very well at this point, then I can both learn and achieve something at every step (I hope).

My prerequisite for this course is Tira, I have not yet taken the Programming techniques course and I am not very experienced with testing. I have chosen Maven project as I am a little familiar with Maven from before, I have never used Gradle. Question: The Testing-and-rmq is based on Gradle, is it wiser to change to Gradle since there are examples provided, or should I stick to Maven?

The project:
For a start I was thinking to look at maze creation, like a maze generator. Maybe choose a specific type of maze and see what data structures and algorithms are needed. For example take the perfect maze (reading from the site: http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) and choose one of the algorithms for the creation to implement. That could be really interesting.

Another question: is this report now a markdown document? Not quite sure I understood the meaning of markdown.
